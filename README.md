## Trivia Game

Use "npm run dev-staging" to run against the server at trivia.run. All commits to the main branch will automatically update the live game page.

You can also run against a local copy of the trivia.run server by checking out the code in the kowsen/trivia-run repository, starting it in dev mode, and then starting this server with the "npm run dev" command.
